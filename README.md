# TopArtists
This is the first of a series of five assignments for the Data Structures class I'm taking. The program retrieves data from a .csv file, sorts the file, removes duplicates and deposits data to 
a .txt file. 

This program is written in Java 8. It transfers unsorted data from a .csv file to a 2D String ArrayList. Further, the data is moved to a LinkedList where it is sorted and is rid of duplicates.

This assignment can be considered submited but not complete. I am planning on improving the code and its complexity as I learn more in class.  

The repository consists of 5 files.

TopArtists holds the source code.
Driver is operational.
output is raw data.
input is cleaned data.
README file.

The file sample I have decided to use is a 201 line .csv in 5 columes. I picked this version over a custom made shorter file because it holds a realistic set of uncleaned data. The original 200 line 
file came without duplicates. I added one to test the code.
